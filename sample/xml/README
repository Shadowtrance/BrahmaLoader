XML loader example for use with Brahma 2 / *hax 2.5+
====================================================

Introduced with *hax 2.5, the HB launcher can now use XML files
to load .3DSX binaries with start parameters. This folder contains
one sample XML folder (for autoloading the ReiNAND CFW via Brahma 2)
and another folder containing a Microsoft Windows batch script to
easily generate SMDH icon/description files yourself. 

If you just want to try it :
- Make sure your *hax is up to date, see here: http://smealum.github.io/3ds/
- Have Brahma 2 ("Brahma2.3dsx"/".smdh") installed in /3DS/Brahma2/
- Copy "reinand.xml" and "reinand.smdh" to /3DS/
- Also make sure you have the ReiNAND CFW installed ("reiNand.dat" in root)
- You have a new entry in your HB launcher, use it to boot ReiNAND via Brahma

If you want to make your own:
- Open reinand.xml in a text editor of your choice
- In <args>, put "[PAYLOAD_PATH] [OFFSET_HEX] [MAX_SIZE_HEX]"
  note: [MAX_SIZE_HEX] and [OFFSET_HEX] are optional, just
        "/Decrypt9.bin" would be valid as well
- If you want a custom icon, put the path to your SMDH into <icon>

Creating SMDHs? It's easy... (Windows only)
- Check out the folder called "zzz_create_smdh"
- Here, replace the icon.png with a 48x48 icon of your choice
- Open the file called "create_smdh.bat" in a text editor of your choice
- Here, replace the names/descriptions/paths as you see fit, then save
- Run "create_smdh.bat" via a double click in Windows Explorer
